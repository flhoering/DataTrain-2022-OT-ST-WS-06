# Avoid this kind of versioning

This is not a real exercise. This is just here to demonstrate what you should avoid when working with files.

1. You are working on a file. Called `document.txt`.
2. You modify this file till the point were you want to make major changes. Before doing them you copy this file to `document-v2.txt`.
