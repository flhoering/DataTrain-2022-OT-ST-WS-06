# Avoid this kind of versioning

This is not a real exercise. This is just here to demonstrate what you should avoid when working with files.

1. You are working on a file. Called `document.txt`.
2. You modify this file till the point were you want to make major changes. Before doing them you copy this file to `document-v2.txt`.
3. Pretend that you want to send this file to a friend.
4. You collect the feedback in a new file called `document-v2-final_draft.txt`.
5. Now you got a new base and send this document to another friend.
6. Their feedback you collect in `document-v2-final_draft.txt`.
7. You update this file until you are satisfied and name it `document-final.txt`.
8. On your way to publish it someone takes a look at it and finds some issues.
9. You update the file to `document-final-fixed.txt`.
10. Anxious as you now are be all these fixes you update this file once more and got the final version `document-FINAL-FINAL.txt`
