# Branches and Merging

## 4.1 Branches

1. Create a new branch
2. Check the status
3. Apply commits to this branch, e.g. modify a file, add files...
4. Switch back to main
5. Take a look at the changed files
6. Create another branch
7. Apply commits to this branch

```bash
# Create a new branch

The branch could not be deleted because Git tries to prevent loss of changes. If you wanted to, you could merge the branch now. In this case, I want you to force delete the branch.

```bash
# Force delete the branch
# git branch --delete --force <branch_name>
# or short: 
# git branch -D <branch_name>
git branch --delete --force other_branch
```

Output:

```bash
$ git branch --delete --force other_branch
Deleted branch other_branch (was 78cde3e).
```

## 4.3 Merge conflict

1. Create a new brannch
2. Add a new line to the README.md
3. Commit the changes
4. Switch to main
5. Add a new line with different text to the README.md
6. Commit the changes
7. Merge the new branch
8. Check the status
9. Resolve the conflict
10. Commit the changes
11. Delete the new branch
11. Check the status

<details>
<summary>Commands</summary>

```bash
# Create a new brannch
# Add a new line to the README.md
 echo "This was added within the conflicting branch" >> .\README.md
# Commit the changes
git add .\README.md
git commit -m "add a conflicting line to README.md"
# Switch to main
git switch main
# Add a new line with different text to the README.md
echo "This was added within the main branch" >> README.md
# Commit the changes
git add README.md
git commit -m "add a line to the README.md"
# Merge the new branch
git merge conflicting
# Check the status
git status
# Resolve the conflict
## Open your editor of choice and remove >>>HEAD, === and <<< conflicting
## save the file
# Check the status
git add README.md
git commit
git branch --delete conflicting
