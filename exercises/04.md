The branch could not be deleted because Git tries to prevent loss of changes. If you wanted to, you could merge the branch now. In this case, I want you to force delete the branch.

```bash
# Force delete the branch
# git branch --delete --force <branch_name>
# or short: 
# git branch -D <branch_name>
git branch --delete --force other_branch
```

Output:

```bash
$ git branch --delete --force other_branch
Deleted branch other_branch (was 78cde3e).
```
