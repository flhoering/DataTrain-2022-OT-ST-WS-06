# DataTrain | OT-ST-WS-06 | Git / GitHub

## 0. Preparation

Before attending the course, follow the steps in the [Setup guide](documentation/00-setup-your-environment.md).

## 1. Onboarding 

Before we start. Lets check your [check your configuration](excercises/01.md) first.

## 2. Why using a version control system

### 2.1 Iterations of working documents

When I worked on a document, I started with a file, let's call it `document.txt`.
As the work progressed, for example when updating the layout, I didn't want to lose anything and renamed the file to `document-v2.txt`.
Now the madness begins. I send this file to a friend to review it. They send me their feedback, and I work it into a file called `document-v2-final_draft.txt`. I send this to another friend and collect their feedback in `document-v2-final_draft2.txt`. 
Finally, I finish the document and name it `document-final.txt`. Before I print or publish it, I ask my dear mother to review it, and you may have guessed it, she sends me back the file `document-final-fixed.txt`. I look at the changes and find a few more problems, so I have this file `document-FINAL-FINAL.txt`.

At this point, my project folder will look something like this:

```bash
my-project
├── document.txt
├── document-v2.txt
├── document-v2-final_draft.txt
├── document-v2-final_draft2.txt
├── document-final.txt
├── document-final-fixed.txt
└── document-FINAL-FINAL.txt
```

Even worse, these files can be active at the same time, as I may be making changes to the `document-final.txt` file while someone else is correcting the same file I sent them.

    section Document
    document.txt : done, doc1, 2022-06-10, 2022-06-14
    document-v2.txt : done, doc2, 2022-06-14, 2022-06-17
    document-v2-final-draft.txt : done, doc3, 2022-06-17, 2022-06-18
    document-v2-final-draft.txt : done, doc4, 2022-06-18, 2022-06-20
    document-final.txt : active, doc5, 2022-06-20, 2022-06-26
    document-final-fixed.txt : active, doc5, 2022-06-24, 2022-06-27
    document-FINAL-FINAL.txt : active, doc5, 2022-06-27, 2022-06-28
```

Now imagine what this might look like for projects with multiple files, such as source code or larger projects like books, papers, and so on.

In the early era of software development in the 1960s and 1970s, the need arose for a system to manage these changes in a logical way. The first [Source Code Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System) was developed in 1972. Later, other version control systems were developed. The most commonly used system is the one we are talking about today.
